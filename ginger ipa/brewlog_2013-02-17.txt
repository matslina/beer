== Recipe

Simplifying and changing up the recipe a bit. Threw out the biscuit
malt and 20L crystal. Bumped up the 60L crystal instead. Curious to
see what happens.

Also replaced the Galena hops with Pilgrim and threw out the
Chinook. Not really on purpose, I just couldn't find Galena or Chinook
at my LHBS.

Ingredients:
  600 g Crystal 60L
 2500 g Medium DME
   70 g Pilgrim (12%)
   60 g Fuggles
   60 g Ginger
  500 g Honey
