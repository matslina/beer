== Recipe

Simplifying and changing up the recipe a bit. Threw out the biscuit
malt and 20L crystal. Bumped up the 60L crystal instead. Curious to
see what happens.

Also replaced the Galena hops with Pilgrim and threw out the
Chinook. Not really on purpose, I just couldn't find Galena or Chinook
at my LHBS.

Ingredients:
  600 g Crystal 60L
 2500 g Medium DME
   70 g Pilgrim (12%)
   60 g Fuggles
   60 g Ginger
  500 g Honey

== Brew day (2013-02-17)

Steeped the crystal malt in 11 litres at roughly 67 C for 30
minutes. Brought it to a boil.

Schedule:
  0  min: 30 g Pilgrim
  15 min: 30 g Pilgrim
  30 min: 10 g Pilgrim
  45 min: 15 g Fuggles
          500 g Honey
          yeast nutrient
          protafloc
  50 min: 60 g ginger
  60 min: 45 g Fuggles

OG: 1.054
20 litres

Fermenting with Safale US-05. Aerated by shaking the bucket for a few
minutes.

== Dry hopping (2013-03-16)

Dry hopping with 50 grams of Amarillo after 4 weeks on primary.

FG: 1.009

Tastes like beer! Definitely ready to bottle.

== Bottling (2013-03-19)

No snags. Tasted it after priming; obviously very sweet, but overall
good and clean. A tad bitter perhaps. Will surely mellow out over
time.

FG: 1.009
ABV: 5.9%

== Sampling (2013-04-27)

Very drinkable. Bitterness has mellowed out somewhat but is still
clearly present. Gingery aroma, as expected.

It does strike me as somewhat less complex than the unmodified
recipe. Would love to brew this again using both crystal
malts. Perhaps make yet another batch with biscuit malt and see what
that does.

Still, drinkable and tasty. Happy with the result.
