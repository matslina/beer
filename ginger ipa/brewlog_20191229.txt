== Recipe

Scaling this down to roughly 2 gal. Rounding all the numbers pretty
liberally here (for simplicity) so it'll be a bit different from the
previous batches.

Replacing Galena and Amarillo with Chinook; Fuggle with
Willamette. DME instead of LME. Again, simplicity.


Ingredients:
   4 oz American Crystal 20L
   2 oz American Crystal 60L
   2 oz Belgian Biscuit
   2 lbs light DME
   6 oz Honey
 1.5 oz Chinook hops
 0.5 oz Willamette hops
 0.5 oz Ginger
   1 pack Safale S-04

Steep the grains for 30 minutes in 1 gal at 66 C. Gradually
bring temperature up to 77 C.

Add the DME and honey. Bring to boil. Start timer.

Schedule:
  0  min: 0.5 oz Chinook
  30 min: 0.5 oz Chinook
  45 min: 0.5 oz Ginger (chopped)
  60 min: 0.5 oz Willamette (flameout)

Top off to 2 gal. Cool to room temperature. Add yeast. Ferment.

Dry hop with the remaining 0.5 oz Chinook.


== Brew day (2019-12-29)

No major changes to the recipe above. Added yeast nutrients (1.5 tsp)
at 50 minutes.

Our kettle is <2 gal, so I boiled and cooled about 3/4 gal of water
separately to dilute with later. Also used about a cup of this water
to rehydrate the yeast.

This is the first time I brew in an American kitchen. The differences
from Stockholm include having a much larger sink, a gas stove and a
freezer with built in ice machine. The gas stove produced a very nice
rolling boil. The sink and ice machine enabled me to cool the wort
pretty quickly without needing an immersion chiller.

Temperature control while steeping the malts was a bit tricky. I don't
have a good thermometer and had to rely on a cheap meat thermometer
instead. I think it Worked out ok anyway, but it would be nice having
something that's easier to read.

Added some water to the boil around 55 minutes to adjust for what had
boiled off, but I didn't add enough! The ~3/4 gal I had set aside for
topping off wasn't sufficient to hit the full 2 gal. Ended up adding 6
cups of water straight from the tap. Not ideal, but it'll work out.

A fair bit of the lost volume was due to trub, which I had completely
forgotten to take into account. Also lost 1.5 cups of the undiluted
wort to a sample that I took before diluting (because stupid). That
had SG at 1.092

OG: 1.049

== Note on fermentation (2020-01-05)

Fermentation started within 12 hours, but there was very little
pressure build up visible in the airlock. Didn't hear or see a single
bubble. After perhaps 1 or 2 days, I couldn't see any visual
indication of active fermentation.

This is similar to the cider I made November 5th, and I think the
brewdemon fermentor is to blame. For the next batch, I think I'll try
some thread sealing tape. If that doesn't work, I might just get rid
of it.

Another issue is that the trub reaches above the spigot in the
brewdemon, rendering it useless for my purposes. Same thing happened
with the cider. The whole point was to not have to siphon it off into
a bottling bucket, but all the gunk around the spigot makes that a no
go. I'll have to siphon this batch too.

== Dry hopping (2020-01-07)

Added 0.7 oz Chinook pellets to fermentor and took a sample.

SG: 1.006

Lower than I had expected. After some head scratching, I've concluded
that this is likely due to my "liberal rounding" when scaling down the
recipe.

Here are the ratios of Crystal malt to DME, Honey to DME and FG for
the four batches, ordered chronologically, with the fourth set of
numbers representing this current batch:

Crystal to DME: 0.24,  0.20,  0.24,  0.19
Honey to DME:   0.21,  0.16,  0.20,  0.19
FG:             1.009, 1.010, 1.009, 1.006

When the Crystal ratio was on the higher end (contributing more
unfermentables and increasing FG) the honey ratio was also higher
(resulting in more fermentables and decreasing FG). For this last batch,
Crystal was lowish, while honey was highish. A low FG seems like a
reasonable result.

The sample itself tasted fine, but was still very bitter. Is the hop
to overall volume ratio is off as well?

Multiplying the hop contribution in grams by the alpha acid
composition and dividing it by the overall volume should give us a
measure of alpha acids per liter of beer. For the previous batches,
this works out to roughly 0.53 units/liter, and 0.82 units/liter for
this batch. Almost a 50% increase.

Plugged the above recipe into the Brewer's Friend calculator. Here are
the predictions:

OG: 1.055
FG: 1.012
IBU: 150

Fortunately, the internet says IBU >110 is impossible unless special
hop extracts are added. Let's say we hit 100 IBU in the brew kettle. I
more than doubled the volume by dilution, so overall IBU ough to be
below 50. Lower end of the IPA range.

== Fining (2020-01-11)

Dissolved ~2 grams of flavourless gelatine in 3 oz of water at ~150
F. Added to fermentor.

== Bottling (2020-01-12)

Dissolved 35 grams of table sugar in 1 cup of water. Boiled it.

Siphoned to bottling bucket. Very hazy. Should probably have given the
gelatine more time.

From bottling bucket to my brand new 1.5 gal Turbokeg. Would estimate
that I put in 1.25 - 1.4 gal. The remainder was enough for two 12 oz
bottles and a fairly gunky pint sized sample. I forgot to flush the
keg with CO2 btw.

Total volume in fermentor was about 1.9 gal. Got about 1.6 on bottle
and keg. Lots of gunk in the bottom.

Taste is bitter and gingery. Will need a couple of weeks to mellow
out. I think it'll turn out well enough.

OG: 1.006 - 1.007 (with priming sugar, because stupid)

Note on kegging: This is great. So much easier than bottles. I might
just put the whole volume on keg next time around just to eliminate
the bottling bucket from the equation.
