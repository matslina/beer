# Potato Pale Ale

Po-ta-toes. Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a brew.

*Potatoes and malted grains*

Many years ago, I promished an irishman I'd make him a potato beer in
return for a couple of bottles of Westvleteren 12 he'd given me. This
is my first attempt at that.

I have a mixed bag of pilsner, crystal and flaked corn at home. Had
accidentally failed to check the "mill grains separately" box when I
ordered them, so it was completely useless for the recipes I was
planning (a pale ale and a cream ale). Figured I'd take this
opportunity to use it before it goes bad. Ordered an additional 2 lbs
of Maris Otter to complete the grain bill. Same goes for the hops btw;
it's just a mix of leftovers I happened to have in my freezer

## Recipe

Fermentables:
- 5 lbs Potatoes ("Yellow" from Whole Foods)
- 2 lbs Maris Otter
- 1 lbs Belgian Pilsner
- 10 oz Flaked Corn
- 5 oz Crystal 60L

Hops:
- 0.5 oz Perle (8 AA)
- 0.25 oz Columbus (16 AA)
- 0.1 oz Cascade (6 AA)
- 0.1 oz Chinook (13 AA)

Schedule:
- 60 min: Perle
- 10 min: Columbus
- 0 min: Cascade & Chinook

Yeast: OSLO

Predictions:
- OG 1.052
- FG 1.010
- ABV 5.54%
- IBU 41.4
- SRM 8.25

Although I really doubt that Brewer's Friend is getting the potatoes
right. I'm using an optimal PPG of 7.5 for the calculations. Hoping
for 70% efficiency like last time I did BIAB.

Peeled, boiled and mashed (i.e. crushed) the potatoes. Mashed
(i.e. steeped in water) with the grains at 150-156 F for 90
minutes. Mostly at the lower end of that range. Squeezed the grain bag
quite a bit. Didn't really sparge at all.

SG is around 1.055. Forgot to record the sample temperature so the
adjustment may be a bit off. But close enough I'm sure. Topped off to
about 2.6-2.7 gal. Added 6 drops Fermcap. Boiled according to
schedule, but with 1/2 whirlfloc tablet added at 10 minutes.

Cooled to about 40 C. Let it stand undisturbed for about 2 hours and
then transferred to fermenter. Really cloudy in spite of that time
span. I imagine that's in part due to the high temperature, but
primarily from the potatoes. Got 2 gallons on fermenter.

Pitched yeast (harvested from my previous pale ale batch), dropped in
my tilt and set it to ferment in a water bath around 35 C.

- OG: 1.052 (Hydrometer)
- OG: 1.050 (Tilt)
