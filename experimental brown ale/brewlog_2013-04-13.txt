My crush of the chocolate malt may have been a bit too fine. Lots of
malty gunk floating up as the temperature rises. No problems
otherwise.

Steeping was at 68 - 65 C for 35 minutes.

OG was 1.053.

== Bottling (2013-04-27)

FG: 1.011
ABV: 5.5%

Tasted like a not very exciting and not very complex brown ale. A few
months on bottle will hopefully change that.
