# Posh Gruit

Instead of hops, we'll primarily be using Bog Myrtle and Labrador Tea
for bittering.

The Labrador Tea is most likely Rhododendron Columbianum, also known
as western labrador tea. The more traditional herb for a gruit would
be _northern_ labrador lea (Rhododendron Tomentosum), a.k.a. wild
rosemary, or "skvattram" in Swedish. The western variety should work
well enough and was easier have shipped to NYC.

Bog Myrtle (Myrica Gale), a.k.a. sweetgale, is another common gruit
herb. It's called "pors" in Swedish, which is pronounced a bit like
_posh_. Hence, this experimental gruit is named _Posh Gruit_.

Recipe is largely inspired by [this
recipe](https://www.beercraftr.com/1-gallon-bog-myrtle-gruit/), but
adapted to extract brewing and uses a hop that I happen to have at
home.

## Brewday (2020-02-05)

Accidentally added 0.7 lbs LME, i.e. 0.1 lbs extra. Intentionally
added 1/5 whirlfloc tablet at 10 minutes. Other than that, everything
went according to plan. Fermentation kicked off within 12 hours.

Tasted mostly like a regular wort. Low bitterness, but still largely
like something bittered primarily with hops.

Tried to let this batch settle to eliminate trub transfer, but that
didn't work so well. The wort was very cloudy, full of gunk floating
around. Guessing it's from the herbs.

OG: 1.074

## Fining (2020-02-16)

Probably not worth the effort, but I was adding gelatine to my pale
ale so I figured I might as well do it for the gruit. It's now resting
in a cooler space where I expect it to drop to about 10C.

## Bottling (2020-02-21)

Primed with 11 grams of table sugar in 1/4 cup of water. Given a
volume of 5*12 oz, that should result in 2.4 volumes of CO2.

Solid yeast cake in the bottom of the fermenter. Some vegetable matter
floating on top from the herbs. Siphoned over without problem. Got 4
bottles and would guess I had ~1 bottle left in the bucket afterwards.

Taste was pretty interesting. Somewhat similar to my Ginger IPA, but
different. Pretty good, and immediately made me think I should make
more. But then there's this aftertaste I can't quite put my finger
on. Sourness? Not the infected kind. Perhaps due to the acidulated
malt? Will have to wait and see how it turns out once it's carbonated.
