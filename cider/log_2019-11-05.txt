== Recipe ==

Ingredients:

 2 gal raw apple juice
 1/2 pack Safale S-04 dry yeast
 1 bag of black tea
 1 tsp pectic enzyme
 2 tsp yeast nutrient

Pour apple juice into sanitized fermenter.

If juice is unpasteurized: Crush and add campden tablets. Let it sit
for 24-36 hours.

Bring 1-2 cups of water to a boil. Remove from heat and steep the tea
for 5-10 minutes. Pour the tea into fermenter.

Add 1 tsp of pectic enzyme, 2 tsp yeast nutrient and pitch the
yeast. Let it ferment for 3-4 weeks.

== Cider making day! (2019-11-13)

Last time I made a cider was in late 2015. It was pretty awful. Not
sure what went wrong that time. Perhaps a whole lime's worth of juice
was too much? Perhaps the black tea mucked everything up? Perhaps
boiling the pectic enzyme was the issue? Or was it the brown sugar?
Perhaps just an infection.

Either way, this time I'll do a smaller, less fancy batch.

Got a new 3 gallon fermenter (suitable for 2-2.5 gal batches) called
the Brewdemon. It's a cheap, plastic, conical fermenter. Has a
convenient spigot which should make bottling (straight from primary)
quick and easy. Although that will make priming for carbonation a bit
tricky. Hmm. Will have to think more about that.

The juice was pasteurized, so this was just a matter of sanitizing,
adding the ingredients and sealing.

But, as always, something goes wrong. I forgot about the tea bag I had
left steeping in hot water. Fermenter lid was already sealed when I
realized that. Reopened and poured in the tea. Immediately realized
that that might've been a bad idea as the layer of dry yeast on top
completely disappeared.

Did I kill it the yeast? No idea. Did this mess up the pectic enzyme?
Probably not. After all, it was 1.5 cup in 2 gallons of cider. Decided
to add the second half of the yeast pack before resealing the
lid. Just in case.

Put the fermenter in a large plastic bag (in case it leaks) and moved
it into a closet. Now we wait.

Specific gravity reading was 1.046 before adding 1.5 cup of tea
water. Used an online calculator to compute the diluted gravity.

OG: 1.044
