Cecilia helped out. We mostly followed the recipe but added 4 tsp of
yeast nutrient instead of 1, coz the pack said 1 per gallon.

Not much head space in the fermentor. A bit concerned about that. Will
keep the bucket on the bathroom floor for the first few days, just in
case.

OG: 1.054

Added 2 packs of dry Notthingham ale yeast. Had kept these packs in
the fridge for about a year. Best before date was early 2016. The
batch started bubbling away nicely within 4 hours of pitching.
